#: ../../source/development/internals.rst:18
msgid ":class:`Index`: the generic \"ordered set\" object, an ndarray of object dtype assuming nothing about its contents. The labels must be hashable (and likely immutable) and unique. Populates a dict of label to location in Cython to do ``O(1)`` lookups."

#: ../../source/development/internals.rst:54
msgid "You can probably guess that the codes determine which unique element is identified with that location at each layer of the index. It's important to note that sortedness is determined **solely** from the integer codes and does not check (or care) whether the levels themselves are sorted. Fortunately, the constructors :meth:`~MultiIndex.from_tuples` and :meth:`~MultiIndex.from_arrays` ensure that this is true, but if you compute the levels and codes yourself, please be careful."

msgid "pandas extends NumPy's type system with custom types, like :class:`Categorical` or datetimes with a timezone, so we have multiple notions of \"values\". For 1-D containers (``Index`` classes and ``Series``) we have the following convention:"
