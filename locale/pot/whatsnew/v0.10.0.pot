#: ../../source/whatsnew/v0.10.0.rst:40
msgid "The default behavior of binary operations between a DataFrame and a Series has always been to align on the DataFrame's columns and broadcast down the rows, **except** in the special case that the DataFrame contains time series. Since there are now method for each binary operator enabling you to specify how you want to broadcast, we are phasing out this special case (Zen of Python: *Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules*).
