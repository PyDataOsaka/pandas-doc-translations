msgid "This is a minor release from 0.7.2 and fixes many minor bugs and adds a number of nice new features. There are also a couple of API changes to note; these should not affect very many users, and we are inclined to call them \"bug fixes\" even though they do constitute a change in behavior. See the :ref:`full release notes <release>` or issue tracker on GitHub for a complete list."

msgid "In comparisons, NA / NaN will always come through as ``False`` except with ``!=`` which is ``True``. *Be very careful* with boolean arithmetic, especially negation, in the presence of NA data. You may wish to add an explicit NA filter into boolean array operations if you are worried about this:"

msgid "While propagating NA in comparisons may seem like the right behavior to some users (and you could argue on purely technical grounds that this is the right thing to do), the evaluation was made that propagating NA everywhere, including in numerical arrays, would cause a large amount of problems for users. Thus, a \"practicality beats purity\" approach was taken. This issue may be revisited at some point in the future."
