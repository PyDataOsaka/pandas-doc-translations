msgid "This is a bug fix release from 0.9.0 and includes several new features and enhancements along with a large number of bug fixes. The new features include by-column sort order for DataFrame and Series, improved NA handling for the rank method, masking functions for DataFrame, and intraday time-series filtering for DataFrame."

msgid "``Series.sort``, ``DataFrame.sort``, and ``DataFrame.sort_index`` can now be specified in a per-column manner to support multiple sort orders (:issue:`928`)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew/v0.9.1.rst:37
msgid "``DataFrame.rank`` now supports additional argument values for the ``na_option`` parameter so missing values can be assigned either the largest or the smallest rank (:issue:`1508`, :issue:`2159`)"

msgid "DataFrame currently supports slicing via a boolean vector the same length as the DataFrame (inside the ``[]``). The returned DataFrame has the same number of columns as the original, but is sliced on its index."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew/v0.9.1.rst:68
msgid "If a DataFrame is sliced with a DataFrame based boolean condition (with the same size as the original DataFrame), then a DataFrame the same size (index and columns) as the original is returned, with elements that do not meet the boolean condition as ``NaN``. This is accomplished via the new method ``DataFrame.where``. In addition, ``where`` takes an optional ``other`` argument for replacement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/whatsnew/v0.9.1.rst:81
msgid "Furthermore, ``where`` now aligns the input boolean condition (ndarray or DataFrame), such that partial selection with setting is possible. This is analogous to partial setting via ``.ix`` (but on the contents rather than the axis labels)"
