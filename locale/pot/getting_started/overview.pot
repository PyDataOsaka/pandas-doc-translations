msgid "pandas is a `Python <https://www.python.org>`__ package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, **real-world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on its way toward this goal."

msgid "The two primary data structures of pandas, :class:`Series` (1-dimensional) and :class:`DataFrame` (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. For R users, :class:`DataFrame` provides everything that R's ``data.frame`` provides and much more. pandas is built on top of `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`__ and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries."

msgid "Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages: munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas is the ideal tool for all of these tasks."

#: ../../source/getting_started/overview.rst:71
msgid "pandas is **fast**. Many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been extensively tweaked in `Cython <https://cython.org>`__ code. However, as with anything else generalization usually sacrifices performance. So if you focus on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster specialized tool."

#: ../../source/getting_started/overview.rst:96
msgid "The best way to think about the pandas data structures is as flexible containers for lower dimensional data. For example, DataFrame is a container for Series, and Series is a container for scalars. We would like to be able to insert and remove objects from these containers in a dictionary-like fashion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/getting_started/overview.rst:102
msgid "Also, we would like sensible default behaviors for the common API functions which take into account the typical orientation of time series and cross-sectional data sets. When using the N-dimensional array (ndarrays) to store 2- and 3-dimensional data, a burden is placed on the user to consider the orientation of the data set when writing functions; axes are considered more or less equivalent (except when C- or Fortran-contiguousness matters for performance). In pandas, the axes are intended to lend more semantic meaning to the data; i.e., for a particular data set, there is likely to be a \"right\" way to orient the data. The goal, then, is to reduce the amount of mental effort required to code up data transformations in downstream functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/getting_started/overview.rst:113
msgid "For example, with tabular data (DataFrame) it is more semantically helpful to think of the **index** (the rows) and the **columns** rather than axis 0 and axis 1. Iterating through the columns of the DataFrame thus results in more readable code:"

msgid "All pandas data structures are value-mutable (the values they contain can be altered) but not always size-mutable. The length of a Series cannot be changed, but, for example, columns can be inserted into a DataFrame. However, the vast majority of methods produce new objects and leave the input data untouched. In general we like to **favor immutability** where sensible."
